# The point system

Points are the currency of Highway! Here's everything you need to know about them.

As always, if you have any questions, ask in #highway-help!

*This page will be updated as more questions get asked*

## Overview

Points are awarded when you either:

- Get a design **approved**
    - *Note that not all submitted designs will be approved; they will get checked by a human first*
    - **Starter projects**: 4 points
    - **Custom projects**: 6 points by default, 10 for advanced projects.
- Attend a Highway event
    - Generally, 1 point
    - Attending the Kickoff Call will give you 1 point!
    - Check the [Events](/events) tab for more!

By default, custom projects give you **6 points**, but if its a particularly complicated project (i.e 3D printer), you can get 10 points out from it!

To get 10 points, you MUST get confirmation on your idea BEFORE working on it first. Pitch it in #highway-pitstop + get a confirmation before working on it!
