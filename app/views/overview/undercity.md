# Undercity

**Undercity** is a 4 day hardware hackathon hosted at GitHub HQ in San Francisco, California, USA from July 11-14th.

To qualify for Undercity, you need at least 12 points and 1 *physically built*, working hardware project.

## Travel Stipends

You'll automatically qualify for a reimbursment once you have **finished building the projects you submitted for Undercity**. 

The amount will be revealed at the kickoff call!

Travelling by car, bus, or train? The [Hack Club Gas Fund](https://gas.hackclub.com/) can reimburse your costs! However, you'll still need an invite to come.

## What's a hackathon?

A social making marathon! Team up with other teenagers around the world and try to make the goofiest, coolest project in 72 hours - from start to finish. At the end, you'll demo your project to others, and there will be prizes! 

Throughout the hackathon, there'll be plenty of activities and workshops you can go to. Ever want to compete in a macropad speedrun or play smash with custom characters at 2am? There will be tons of things you can do here!
