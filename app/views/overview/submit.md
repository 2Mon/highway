# Submitting projects

Submitting your project is SUPER easy! Once you have everything ready, **fill out the following form**:

https://forms.hackclub.com/highway

Please double check that you have everything necessary! This will depend on your project, but generally check for:

- if doing a starter, the requirements on the project's website
- if doing a custom project, read [here](/advanced/submitting)
- a proper README.md file in your repository (includes images, a description, etc)
- a full BOM with links
- all project source files

**USING AI TO GENERATE A README.md FILE OR A JOURNAL IS STRICTLY DISALLOWED**

If your project is rejected for any reason, you will have to wait 1 week before it gets re-reviewed

Approval **does not** guarantee that your project will be functional - that is on you to check. Please ask in #highway and get help from other people to make sure it works before submitting!
