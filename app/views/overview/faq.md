# FAQ

#### How will I get my 3D printed parts?
Through **printing legion**! It's an international network of Hack Clubbers 3D printing for each other, sponsored by Polymaker (website coming soon!)

#### What's the likelihood of my project getting approved?

High! We're estimating around 95% projects will get approved when reviewed. Our mission is for teenagers to build cool projects, and we want to maximize that!

**What we check for when reviewing:**

- For Starter projects: 
    - They look like they would work
    - A good README
- For Custom projects: 
    - Effort was put into it
    - Your project has *spice* - something unique with flavour added
    - A good README and journal
    - You made it yourself - commit often!

**Reasons why your project might be rejected:**

- It's low effort / feels like spam
- The BOM price is unreasonable for project complexity 
- The journal doesn't adequately explain project creation process
- Project descriptions/journals were AI generated

This isn't a competition - we'll fund as many projects as people make. Help your peers, get help from your peers, so that everyone gets approved projects!

If you're unsure about something, ask in #highway!

#### Are group projects allowed for Highway?

Groups up to 2 for each project are allowed!

However:

- Your grant is still *per project*, not per person
- The points you get upon project completion are split evenly 

If you're building something *really big* and *require* multiple people (ie: modding a bus to fly????) feel free to try pitching it in #highway-pitstop. No guarentees though. 

#### Can I do Highway, but not go to Undercity?

Yes! 

But we highly recommend you come - it will be the most fun of times :D

#### Can points be used for something else?

Not as of right now. For those who get *above* 12 points, we *might* have some special swag planned. No promises.
