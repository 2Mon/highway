# Guide

### Welcome to the **Highway** to **Undercity**, an unforgettable summer of hardware running from now through July 31st.

If you've *never* done hardware before, this is *your* opportunity to get started. That one project you saw on YouTube but had no idea how to build? *That ends now.*

Earn **points** with each project you build. Collect prizes along the way. Join your friends at Undercity, a 4 day hackathon in San Francisco at GitHub HQ

*Don't forget to join the slack, our community - didn't get an invite? enter your email on the [landing](/)!*

*If you're already a seasoned pro, this is your chance to really level up. That 5-axis 3D printer you've been thinking of? Now's your chance*

## Here's how it works:
---
### 1. Build hardware projects

#### 1. Pick an idea

Pick an idea! You can either choose a [Starter Project](/starter-projects) (4 points) or a [Custom Project](/advanced) (6 or 10 points)

[Starter Projects](/starter-projects) are guided resources that help you build awesome stuff like macropads just like the one below. In exchange, we'll ship you the parts you need to build it!

[Custom projects](/advanced) are fully self-directed! You'll be responsible for all the research, and in return, you'll get a debit card of up to $350* USD to spend on your project!

**by default you only get $150 USD, check out the custom projects section to find out how you can get $350*

#### 2. Ship the design
Shipping your design means sharing it in a way that other people can use what you made! Usually it includes the following:

- A published design on a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository
- A nice README.md file with a description of what your project does & any images
- Any source files that are used for your project

(*what you need specifically will change with each project, so make sure to double check the docs so that you have everything!*)

#### 3. Collect your points & parts
Once you have a shipped project, submit it to our form! 

**If you get approved** you'll get the following; 

- Either a kit of parts (starter project), or a $350* credit card to build your design (custom project)!
- A 3D printed case, printed by another Hack Clubber in your country
- A soldering kit, if you don't have one already

Approval is not guaranteed. Please go over the **submission requirements** of what you're making to make sure you don't get rejected!

[https://forms.hackclub.com/highway](https://forms.hackclub.com/highway)

Make sure to double check your design has everything you need before submitting! 

If it is rejected for any reason, you'll need to wait **1 week** before you can get it re-reviewed

### 2. Join weekly events

Every week, we'll host events like Speedruns, Game Nights, AMAs, and Showcases! 

First one up is the **Kickoff call on Friday, May 23rd at 3:00PM EST**. Get your 1st point for free!

---

### 3. Get invited to Undercity

Once you collect 12 points, AND you've physically built 1 project, you'll get invited to [Undercity](/getting-started/undercity), a 4 day hardware hackathon at GitHub HQ from July 11-14.

It'll be filled to the *brim* with hardware - hundreds of microcontrollers, kilometers of cabling, and more 3D printing than you could ever need. (Did someone mention a PCB mill?)

## Ready. Set. Build!
