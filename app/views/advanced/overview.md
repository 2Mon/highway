# Custom projects

Decided to make a custom project? Awesome! Right this way.

Whatever that one project you've been thinking of doing forever - whether that be a custom 3D printer, a full mechanical keyboard, or something else - now's your chance to make that real

Before you go crazy with ideas though - please be resourceful! This is **not** a free money glitch. [Hack Club](hackclub.com) is a financially limited non profit, and every dollar we can save together goes towards the next program.

Any questions? Join the #highway channel in slack!

### How it works:

1. Start your project
2. Journal & Log your progress along the way
3. Get up to **$150 USD** to get the parts you need to build it.

Each project you design that is approved gets you **6 points**

#### Extra advanced projects - get up to $350 USD & 10 points

Most projects (keyboards, game consoles, custom devboards, etc) can all be built under $150 USD, and while fairly difficult, are still fairly achievable within a couple weeks.

Some projects though are above and beyond - a DIY 5-axis 3D printer, a go-kart from scratch, etc take significantly more time, require a larger budget, and are overall a lot harder to execute.

If you think you have the idea & ability to execute, pitch it in #highway-pitstop **before** working on it. Only start once you're approved!

### Making your project

In short, here's how to start a new project:

1. Make a new GitHub repository
2. Start a journal by creating a file called JOURNAL.md and commit it
3. Make a pull request to add your repository to the website!
4. Start designing your project! Journal each day you work on it!
5. [Submit](/advanced/submitting) your project

To add your project to the website, head on over to the [submissions.yml](https://github.com/hackclub/highway/blob/main/submissions.yml) in the site's repository and add the URL to your project

```
projects:
  - "https://github.com/Dongathan-Jong/SpotifyDisplay"
  - "your_repo_link"
```
<br>
As long as your PR doesn't have any conflicts, we'll merge it and your submission will be added to the project list! Other people will be able to see your journal & see what you're up to.

After that, you're done! You can move onto designing

The gallery will unlock on May 20th, 2025.

### On Journaling

This is *the* most important part of the whole process! Journaling your progress is how to keep track of how your project is going. Beyond that, it's also a way to tell a story and have something to look back at many years down the line.

Don't just journal your wins! It's much, *much* better to maintain a smaller, more consistent one every day - it'll capture a more realistic story to what things were really like. Fails are important

Journaling is **mandatory** to get your submission approved! Poor quality journals will be rejected. 

Do NOT have:

- Wall of timestamps with barely any descriptions
- No images
- Terrible formatting that's impossible to read
- AI generated journal entries; anything written by AI will be automatically rejected

**You can see what the optimal journal entry looks like [here](/advanced/example-journal)**
