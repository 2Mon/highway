# What is shipping?

Shipping is the process of setting up your project in a way that makes it usable by others. This usually involves the following:

- **Having a detailed README.md file that includes some of the following:**
    - A quick story/motivation on how the project came to be
    - A description of what the project does
    - A quick brief on how it all fits together
    - Some pictures of the design
- **Organized folders to make it easy to find what's needed**

When you don't ship your project, you make it impossible for others to tell what the project does & how someone could put it together. It's effectively the same as if you never posted it at all.

*Unfortunately we also can't accept non shipped projects since it'd be impossible to tell what you even made. Make sure to ship your projects!*
