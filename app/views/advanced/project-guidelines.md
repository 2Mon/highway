# Project Guidelines

If you're wondering what you're allowed to build, the bottom line is this:

Build something *awesome*, something that you would be proud to keep in your room for the next 5 years, and something that you would be proud to show other people.

Let's get teenagers to be the ones to make the best projects yet.

## Examples
**Here are some examples of great projects by Hack Clubbers:**

- @Ducc's [Spotify Display](https://github.com/Dongathan-Jong/SpotifyDisplay/), a Spotify Car Thing Clone
- @Cyao's [Icepi Zero](https://github.com/cheyao/icepi-zero), an FPGA development dev board
- @vk6's [Ender X4](https://github.com/ading2210/ender-x4), a 4-toolhead 3D printer

**Here are some examples of what *not* to build:**

- Arduino alarm clock
- Humidity display
- Distance sensor

**Here's some examples of how you could make those projects better:**

- Arduino alarm clock, but it has custom LED lighting that syncs with the time of day & also has a slide switch instead of a button to control it
- A humidity display that's part of a larger weather station setup and compares the internal readings of your house to the outside world 
- A distance sensor that checks if someone is coming to your room & sends an alert to your phone if they do
